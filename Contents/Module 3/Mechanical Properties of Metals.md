## Physical Properties of Materials

### Hooke's Law
When any material is stretched or compressed, it stores some **elastic potential energy**. This energy is stored until the force is removed, and the material springs back to its original shape. 

**Hooke's Law** states that extension is directly proportional to force. However, when the force becomes great enough, materials can be stretched beyond the **limit of proportionality**, meaning the extension is no longer directly proportional to the force.

If a material is stretched beyond the limit of proportionality, it will not return back to its original shape when the force is removed.

### Deformation

Materials **deform** when they are stretched or compressed. Deformation can be either **elastic** or **plastic**. A material will go through several stages when experiencing deformation:
- **Elastic** deformation occurs within the limit of proportionality, and only temporarily affects the shape of the material.
- **Yield stress** is the stress that causes plastic deformation.
- **Plastic** deformation permanently affects the shape of a material.
- **Fracture stress** will occur if the force is great enough to break the material.

### Describing Material Key Terms

| Term  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Stiff  | Small extension for force applied  |
| Elastic  | Temporarily deformed  |
| Plastic  | Permanently deformed  |
| Ductile  | Can be deformed to a great extent without breaking  |
| Hard  | Resists indentation on impact  |
| Brittle  | Endures little or no plastic deformation before breaking  |
| Tough  | Can endure lots of plastic deformation before breaking  |
| Strong  | Can withstand high stresses  |

### Young's Modulus

**Stress** is the force per unit area applied on an object. It is measured in **Pascals**.

**Strain** is the ratio of the extension of an object to its original length. Strain has no units, as it is a ratio.

**Young's Modulus** is the ratio of stress to strain. Because strain has no ratio, Young's Modulus takes the same units as stress: **Pascals**.

### Metal Structure

The structure of materials is grouped into two broad categories:
- **Crystalline**, with regular organised particles. This means that layers of particles can slide over each other, even if it takes a lot of energy to do so.
- **Amorphous**, with a random and disordered arrangment of particles. This prevents movement within its structure.

**Polycrystalline** structures have regular crystalline segments, but these segments are arranged randomly across the structure.

Metals are either crystalline or polycrystalline. This makes them **malleable** and **ductile** partly due to **dislocations** in the structure. Dislocations are gaps in the crystalline structure which can shift through the metal, causing the metal to deform one atom at a time.

An **alloy** is a metal that contains multiple types of atoms of different sizes. This prevents layers sliding over each other, and also prevent dislocations from moving throughout the structure.

### Polymers
**Polymers** are long chains of repeating monomers. **Crosslinks** are links between polymer chains. These can reduce the flexibility of chains, making the material stiffer. They can also have crystalline and amorphous regions, which behave
differently.
