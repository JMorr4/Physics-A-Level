## Macroscopic Properties of Materials

### Deformation

Hooke's Law says that extension is proportional to force. Hooke's law doesn't just apply to springs and metals, all other materials obey it up to a point.

However, when the force becomes great enough, materials can be stretched beyond the **limit of proportionality**. Just past this limit, when the material is in danger of becoming permanently stretched, is called the **elastic limit**. Some materials, like rubber, only obey Hooke's law for very small extensions.

A stretch can be **elastic** or **plastic**. In **elastic deformation**:
- When the material is put under tension, the atoms are pulled apart from one another.
- Atoms can move relative to their equilibrium position, without changing position in the material.
- Once the load is removed, the atoms return to their equilibrium distance apart.

In **plastic deformation**:
- Some atoms in the material move position relative to one another.
- When the load is removed, the atoms don't return to their original positions.

### Stress and Strain

If forces stretch a material, they are **tensile**. If they squash a material, they are **compressive**:
- Stress is defined as the tension divided by the cross-sectional area, and is measured in **Newton Metres squared** or **Pascals**. 
- Strain is defined as the extension divided by the original length of the material. It has no units, instead it's measured as a **percentage**.

A stress big enough to break a material is called **fracture stress**. The effect of stress pulls atoms away from each other, and in fracture stress, this effect is strong enough to seperate these atoms completely. The point before a material breaks is called the **ultimate tensile strength**. This is the maximum stress a material can withstand before breaking.
