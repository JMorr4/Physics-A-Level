# Imaging and Signalling

## Nature of Waves

Almost all information is transferred by waves. **Progressive** waves carry energy away from its source without transferring any material. Ways to tell if a wave carries energy are:
- **Electromagnetic** waves cause things to heat up
- **X-rays** and **gamma rays** knock electrons out of their orbits, causing **ionisation**
- Loud sounds make things vibrate

Since waves carry energy away, the source of the wave loses energy. Waves have many key terms that can be difficult to remember:
- **Displacement** - How far a point on the wave has moved from its undisturbed position
- **Amplitude** - The maximum displacement
- **Wavelength** - The length of one wave
- **Period** - The time taken for one wavelength to pass thorugh a point
- **Frequency** - The number of wavelengths that pass thorugh a point in one second
- **Phase difference** - The amount by which one wave lags behind another wave. Measured in **degrees** or **radians**.

### Transverse and Longitudinal Waves

A **transverse** wave oscillates perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. All **electromagnetic** waves are transverse waves. A **longitudinal** wave oscillates parallel to the direction of energy transfer. One example of a longitudinal wave is **sound**.

**Intensity** is the rate of energy flow perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer, for example the sun. It is measured in **Watts per squared metre**.

### Polarisation

A **polarised** wave oscillates only in one direction. Polarisation can only occur to transverse waves. When transverse waves, like light, pass through a polarisation filter, they become polarised. Two polarisation filters set up at right angles to each other will block out all light, as all directions of energy transfer is blocked.

In the case of microwaves, polarising filters are ineffective, as their wavelengths are too long. Instead **metal grilles** are used to polarise them.

### Forming images with lenses

**Refraction** occurs when a wave changes speed at a boundary. When a ray of light meets a boundary between one medium and another, some of its energy is lost and reflected back into the first medium, and the rest is transmitted through the second medium. This loss of energy reduces the wave speed, causing refraction.

Lenses add **curvature** to waves as they pass through it. The thicker the lens is, the more curvature is added to the wave. Waves passing through the lens are given spherical curvature, centred on the **focal point** of the lens. There are several key terms concerning lenses that has to be understood:
- The **focal length** is the distance between the focal point and the lens.
- The more powerful a lens is, the more curvature it adds to waves that pass through it. Lens power is measured in **dioptres**.
- There are two types of lens; **Converging** lens and **diverging** lens:
  - Converging lens curve the wave towards the focal point
  - Diverging lens curve the wave away from the focal point

<br>

Converging lens mean that the rays intersect at the focal point, causing a **real** image, whereas diverging lens mean that the rays never intersect, causing a **virtual** image.

### Information in images

Each pixel in an image holds a binary value which corresponds to a colour. This binary value can be changed or altered to change the pixel colour. This can be useful when analysing images.

Key terms:
- **Contrast** - Increasing contrast is achieved by multiplying the binary values by a fixed value.
- **False Colour** - Adding false colour to an image can highlight features, like changing black and white to blue and green on maps.
- **Noise** - Noise is unwanted interference affecting a signal. In images this means bright or dark spots on the picture. Noise can be reduced by replacing pixels with the **mean** of their neighbours.
