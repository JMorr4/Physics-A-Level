## Nature of Waves

Almost all information is transferred by waves. **Progressive** waves carry energy away from its source without transferring any material. Ways to tell if a wave carries energy are:
- **Electromagnetic** waves cause things to heat up
- **X-rays** and **gamma rays** knock electrons out of their orbits, causing **ionisation**
- Loud sounds make things vibrate

Since waves carry energy away, the source of the wave loses energy. Waves have many aspects that can be difficult to remember:
- **Displacement** - How far a point on the wave has moved from its undisturbed position
- **Amplitude** - The maximum displacement
- **Wavelength** - The length of one wave
- **Period** - The time taken for one wavelength to pass thorugh a point
- **Frequency** - The number of wavelengths that pass thorugh a point in one second
- **Phase difference** - The amount by which one wave lags behind another wave. Measured in **degrees** or **radians**.
