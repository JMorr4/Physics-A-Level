# Imaging and Signalling

## Curvature
Waves passing through lenses are given **curvature**. The thicker the lens is, the more powerful it is, and the more curvature it adds to the wave.

There are two types of lens:
- **Converging** lens curve the wave towards the focal point. When these waves intersect at this point, they produce a **real image**.
- **Diverging** lens curve the wave away from the focal point. This means the rays never intersect, causing a **virtual image**.

### Converging lenses
There are several key terms concerning lenses that has to be understood:

- Converging lens curve waves to a point called the **focal point**.
- The **focal length** is the distance between the focal point and the lens.
- A powerful lens add more curvature to a wave. Lens power is measured in **dioptres**. The more powerful a lens is, the smaller the focal length.
- A **converging lens** mean that the rays intersect at the focal point, causing a **real** image.
- A **diverging lens** mean that the rays never intersect, causing a **virtual** image.
- Waves can be modelled using a **ray diagram**, as shown on the right.

## Information in Images

### Changing Images

Each pixel in an image holds a binary value which corresponds to a colour. This binary value can be changed or altered to change the pixel colour. This can be useful when analysing images.

| Process  | Method | Effect |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Increasing Contrast**  | Multiplying the binary values by a fixed value | Image will be more vivid and easier to see |
| **Increasing Brightness**  | Adding a fixed number to each pixel value | Produces a lighter image |
| **Noise Removal**  | Replacing the value of each pixel with the mean of the pixels around it | Creates a smoother images with less bright ot dark spots |
| **Edge detection**  | Subracting the mean value of pixels around it from a pixel value | Produces an only the outlines of an image |

## The Electromagnetic Spectrum
Since waves carry energy away, the source of the wave loses energy. Waves have many key terms that can be difficult to remember:
- **Displacement** - How far a point on the wave has moved from its undisturbed position
- **Amplitude** - The maximum displacement
- **Wavelength** - The length of one wave
- **Period** - The time taken for one wavelength to pass thorugh a point
- **Frequency** - The number of wavelengths that pass thorugh a point in one second
- **Phase difference** - The amount by which one wave lags behind another wave. Measured in **degrees** or **radians**.

### Transverse and Longitudinal Waves
A **transverse** wave oscillates perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. All **electromagnetic** waves are transverse waves. A **longitudinal** wave oscillates parallel to the direction of energy transfer. One example of a longitudinal wave is **sound**.

**Intensity** is the rate of energy flow perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer, for example the sun. It is measured in **Watts per squared metre**.

A **standing wave** is the combination of two waves, each with the same amplitude and frequency, moving in opposite directions. When these waves meet, it can result in two types of interference:
- **Constructive** interference, where the energy of both waves are added together.
- **Destructive** interference, where the energy of both waves are cancelled out.

### Polarisation
A **polarised** wave oscillates only in one direction. Polarisation can only occur to transverse waves. When transverse waves, like light, pass through a polarisation filter, they become polarised. Two polarisation filters set up at right angles to each other will block out all light, as all directions of energy transfer is blocked.

In the case of microwaves, polarising filters are ineffective, as their wavelengths are too long. Instead **metal grilles** are used to polarise them.
