## Circuits

### Current
Current is the flow of charge over time. It is measured in **amperes**. In a **series** circuit, the current is the same at any point in the circuit. In a **parallel** circuit, the current is split between the branches.

This is due to **Kirchoff's first law**, which ensures the conservation of charge:
- When current reaches a junction, it is split between each branch.
- Although each branch may have a different current, the total current before and after the junction will be the same.

### Potential Difference
A cell has a positive terminal on one end and a negative terminal on the other. When both terminals are connected to form a circuit, the **potential difference** between them will cause a current to flow.

Because an electron's charge is negative, current flows from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, as the electrons are repelled from the negative side and attracted to the positive side.

When current flows in a circuit, particles in the metal wire provide resistance against the flow of charge, causing some energy to be wasted as heat. This is called **power dissipation**.

### Resistance and Conductance
**Resistance** is a measure of the opposition to the flow of current. Resistance is provided by metal ions in the wires/components in a circuit. When electrons flow through the wire/component, they collide with the ions, causing them to slow down.

Resistance increases with temperature. This is because the metal ions vibrate more due to their increased kinetic energy, causing more frequent collisions.

**Conductance** is a measure of how well electrons flow through a conductor. **Conductors** are materials that allow current to pass through them freely.

### Resistivity
Resistance and resistivity are two different things. Where resistance takes into account the physical dimensions of a material, **resistivity** focuses only on the properties of the material.
- Resistance is measured in ohms (**Ω**), and it's unit is **R**
- Resitivity is measured in ohms per metre (**Ω/m**), and its unit is **ρ**

### EMF and Internal Resistance
**Electromotive Force (EMF)** is the amount of energy provided by the battery to each coulomb of charge passing through.

**Kirchoff's second law** states that the sum of all the voltages across the circuit must be equal to the EMF of the circuit.

The resistance of a battery in a circuit is called **internal resistance**. Most batteries have some internal resistance, which causes the potential difference provided by the battery to be lower than expected.
