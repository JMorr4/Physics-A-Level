# Waves and Quantum Behaviour

### Wave Properties
Waves have some key terms that can be difficult to remember:
- **Displacement** - How far a point on the wave has moved from its equilibrium position
- **Amplitude** - The maximum displacement
- **Wavelength** - The length of one wave
- **Period** - The time taken for one wavelength to pass through a point
- **Frequency** - The number of wavelengths that pass through a point in one second

## Phase and Phasors

### Phase and phase difference

- The **phase** of a wave refers to a point on the wave cycle.
- Two waves are **in phase** if they are at the same point, but not necessarily the same amplitude, at the same time.
- If two waves are in opposite positions, they are in **antiphase**. Anything inbetween is **out of phase**.
- The **phase difference** between two waves that are out of phase can be worked out using **phasor arrows**.
- Phase difference is measured in **radians**, which is another unit of angle measurement. 360¬∞ = 2ùùÖ radians.

- **Resultant phasors** can be worked out like resultant vectors, where the scale arrows are drawn tip to tail, then connected by a resultant arrow.
- The angle can then be measured from a scale drawing using trigonometry.
- **Coherent waves** are when two waves that have a constant phase difference.

### Path difference
**Path difference** is the difference between the distance travelled by two waves when they meet. A path difference of:
- A multiple of ```distance √ó Œª``` produces waves **in phase**.
- ```(distance + ¬Ω)Œª``` produces waves in **antiphase**.
- Anything inbetween produces waves **out of phase**.

## Standing Waves

### Transverse waves
A **standing wave** is the combination of two waves, each with the same amplitude and frequency, moving in opposite directions. When these waves meet, it can result in two types of **interference**:
- **Constructive** interference, where the energy of both waves are added together. This occurs when the waves are in phase, producing **antinodes**.
- **Destructive** interference, where the energy of both waves are cancelled out. This occurs when the waves are in antiphase, producing **nodes**.

### Longitudinal waves
Standing waves can also form with longitudinal waves.

- In air tubes, sound waves travel along the tube, reflect at the end, and travel back. When the reflected waves meet the initial waves they cause **interference**.
- In an air tube, **antinodes** always form at open ends, and **nodes** always form at closed ends.
- Using the distance between two consecutive nodes, and the frequency, we can work out the speed of sound in air using the formula: ```frequency = velocity /  wavelength```

## Refraction and Diffraction

### Refraction
**Refraction** is the change in wave speed when it reaches a boundary between two mediums.

- The **refractive index** is the ratio of the speed of light between two different mediums.
- The **absolute refractive index** of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in that material to the speed of light in a vacuum.
- **Snell's law** joins the refractive index to the angles of incidence and refraction with the formula:

**Huygens' wavelet model** helps to explain refraction. He described a wave of light being made up of many smaller wavelets. As the wave reaches a boundary at an angle, the wavelets which reach it first slow down, causing the wave to bend towards the slower wavelets.

### Diffraction
**Diffraction** is the spreading out of waves when they pass through a gap which is roughly the same width as their wavelength.

**Young's double slit experiment** uses diffraction. Light passes though two small slits and spreads out. The waves fom each slit **interfere** with each other, producing patterns of light (antinodes), and dark fringes (nodes) on a screen.

**Diffraction gratings** have multiple slits, but work the same way. The distance between each of these slits is called the **slit seperation**. The distance between the patterns of light produced on the screen is called the **fringe spacing**.

Slit seperation is usually expressed using lines per mm, and can be worked out using the formula:

## Quantum Behaviour

### Quanta
Light can also be modelled as a ray of **particles**, or **photons**. A photon carries a fixed quantity of energy, called a **quanta**. The energy of a photon of light depends on its frequency.

The energy of waves is usually very small, so is is measured using **electronvolts**. This is the energy transferred when one electron is moved through one volt. The unit for an electronvolt is **eV**, and its value in joules is:

### The Photoeletric Effect
The **photoelectric effect** occurs when light rays meet the surface of a metal. The quantas of energy carried by the photons are absorbed by the metal, causing them to move up to a higher energy level. 1 photon is absorbed by 1 electron to form 1 **photoelectron**.

**Intensity** is the amount of energy per second per unit area. The more intense the light is, the more electrons are emitted per second.

The number of emitted electrons depends on the intensity, and the energy of these electrons depends on the **frequency**. The higher the frequency of light, the higher the energy of the photoelectrons.

However, the frequency has to be above a certain level called the **threshold frequency**, otherwise no electrons will be emitted at all. The corresponding energy, called the **work function**, is the amount of energy required to liberate electrons from the surface of the metal.

The maximum energy of emitted electrons can be worked out using the formula:

```
Œ¶ = work function of the metal
h = Planck's constant
f = photon frequency
