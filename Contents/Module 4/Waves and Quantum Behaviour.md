# Waves and Quantum Behaviour

## Wave Properties
Waves have many key terms that can be difficult to remember:
- **Displacement** - How far a point on the wave has moved from its undisturbed position
- **Amplitude** - The maximum displacement
- **Wavelength** - The length of one wave
- **Period** - The time taken for one wavelength to pass through a point
- **Frequency** - The number of wavelengths that pass through a point in one second
- **Phase difference** - The amount by which one wave lags behind another wave. Measured in **degrees** or **radians**.
