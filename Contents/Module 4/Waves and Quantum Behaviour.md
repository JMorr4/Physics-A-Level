# Waves and Quantum Behaviour

### Wave Properties
Waves have some key terms that can be difficult to remember:
- **Displacement** - How far a point on the wave has moved from its equilibrium position
- **Amplitude** - The maximum displacement
- **Wavelength** - The length of one wave
- **Period** - The time taken for one wavelength to pass through a point
- **Frequency** - The number of wavelengths that pass through a point in one second

## Phase and Phasors

### Phase and phase difference

- The **phase** of a wave refers to a point on the wave cycle.
- Two waves are **in phase** if they are at the same point, but not necessarily the same amplitude, at the same time.
- If two waves are in opposite positions, they are in **antiphase**. Anything inbetween is **out of phase**.
- The **phase difference** between two waves that are out of phase can be worked out using **phasor arrows**.
- Phase difference is measured in **radians**, which is another unit of angle measurement. 360¬∞ = 2ùùÖ radians.

- **Resultant phasors** can be worked out like resultant vectors, where the scale arrows are drawn tip to tail, then connected by a resultant arrow.
- The angle can then be measured from a scale drawing using trigonometry.
- **Coherent waves** are when two waves that have a constant phase difference.

### Path difference
**Path difference** is the difference between the distance travelled by two waves when they meet. A path difference of:
- A multiple of ```distance √ó Œª``` produces waves **in phase**.
- ```(distance + ¬Ω)Œª``` produces waves in **antiphase**.
- Anything inbetween produces waves **out of phase**.

## Standing Waves

### Transverse waves
A **standing wave** is the combination of two waves, each with the same amplitude and frequency, moving in opposite directions. When these waves meet, it can result in two types of **interference**:
- **Constructive** interference, where the energy of both waves are added together. This occurs when the waves are in phase, producing **antinodes**.
- **Destructive** interference, where the energy of both waves are cancelled out. This occurs when the waves are in antiphase, producing **nodes**.

### Longitudinal waves
Standing waves can also form with longitudinal waves.

- In air tubes, sound waves travel along the tube, reflect at the end, and travel back. When the reflected waves meet the initial waves they cause **interference**.
- In an air tube, **antinodes** always form at open ends, and **nodes** always form at closed ends.
- Using the distance between two consecutive nodes, and the frequency, we can work out the speed of sound in air using the formula: ```frequency = velocity /  wavelength```

## Refraction

**Intensity** is the rate of energy flow perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer, for example the sun. It is measured in **Watts per squared metre**.
