# Investigating Stopping Distances

### Overview

The PAG (Practial Assessment Group) which will be carried out next lesson will be "Investigating Stopping Distances". The overall aim of this practical is to discover how much the momentum of an object travelling down a slope affects it's stopping distance.


### Equipment
- Metre ruler
- Wooden Blocks
- Light gate
- Interruptor card/piece of card 10x10cm


### Theory
The formulas we'll be using for the PAG are listed as follows:

### Method

### Hypothesis

The practical ideally involves a toy car being pushed down a wooden ramp.

### Results

The table should include the intitial velocity, the final velocity, the time and the distance.

### Safety Considerations

### Error Considerations
