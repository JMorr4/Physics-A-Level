# Investigating Stopping Distances

### Overview

The PAG (Practial Assessment Group) which will be carried out next lesson will be "Investigating Stopping Distances". The overall aim of this practical is to discover how much the momentum of an object travelling down a slope affects it's stopping distance.


### Equipment
- Metre ruler
- Crank stand
- Light gate
- Interruptor card/piece of card 6x6cm
- Toy car


### Theory
The formulas we'll be using for the PAG are listed as follows:

### Method

- A vehicle is modelled by the block of wood which is pushed and decelerates due to friction with the surface it moves on.
- Glue the 10 x 10 cm interruptor card to the side of the block of wood so that the time for the width of the card to pass through the gate is recorded. The interruptor card allows the distance moved through the light gate to be fixed, as it registers with the light gate easily without the light gate interrupting the blockâ€™s motion.
- Set up the light gate such that it records the average starting velocity of the block moving through it (speed = 0.1 m/time for card to move through in seconds).
- Record the starting position of the block and position the light gate 2 cm after this point.
- Push the block and record the position at which it stops.
- Record the average starting velocity and the corresponding distance between the light gate and the stopping point (stopping distance), in a table. 

### Hypothesis

The practical involves a toy car being pushed along a flat surface. The surface the car is pushed on and the car mass should stay constant so that the
frictional force varies as little as possible, and the results can remain accurate.

### Results

The table should include the intitial velocity, the final velocity and the distance.

### Safety Considerations

Wear goggles in case a toy car is thrown at your eyes.

### Error Considerations

Various errors in equipment. Human errors involving:
- Errors in calculating velocity.
- Errors in measuring.
- Errors when potentially adding force when placing the car at the top of the ramp.
